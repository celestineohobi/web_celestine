I like to analyze data for trends and patterns and interpret data with a clear objective in mind. I'm also capable of Identifying relevant data sources and sets to mine for client business needs, and collect large structured/unstructured datasets and variables for predictive modelling.

I'm an experienced Data Analyst with a MS in Computer Science who has worked in the Education, Manufacturing, and Asset Management industries. In my latest role, i used SQL to analyze and aggregate data to provide actionable insights to the leadership teams of our client companies. I also consulted on database management best practices for our clients in the financial services industry.
